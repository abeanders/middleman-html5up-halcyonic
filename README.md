# Halcyonic - An [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) theme for Middleman

Halcyon for [Pelican][1] is a clean, simple theme based on the 2-column layout (sidebars on the right) of the HTML5 Up theme of [the same name][2].  
Creation of the theme was another exercise in learning to create themes totally from scratch.  
As such, I made the theme (mostly) modular, so that pretty much any section of the theme can be easily edited (*or removed from the layout entirely*).  
The top navigation menu, social links are configured in `pelicanconf.py` as is the norm.  
The footer (*and the links and blurb therein*) are partials and can be edited separately or removed from the layout.  


Something that seems to be unique (or at the very least, *uncommon*) to my themes/modification of themes is that the dates are English Ordinal (e.g., "June 1st, 2017").

A somewhat unusual but interesting responsive site template. I did this one to test out a
new pattern set I put together and I think it really came together well. As for use cases
it's kind of unspecific so hey, use it for whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
